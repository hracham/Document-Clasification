Abstract Type | iodothyronine deiodinase (D1) is a cru-
cial enzyme which converts the prohormone thyroxine (T4)
into active tri-iodothyronine (T3). There has been strong
evidence that the metabolism of thyroid hormones is dis-
turbed in some neoplastic tissues such as thyroid, renal, and
breast cancer. However, there are few available data about
D1 enzyme activity in benign tumors such as hemangioma,
which is the most common primary liver tumor. Hence this
study aimed to determine the enzymatic activity of D1 in
hemangiomas in relation to healthy liver tissue. Seven
tumors and healthy control tissues were obtained from
patients who had liver resection due to hemangioma. The
activity was assessed by measurement of radioactive iodine
released by deiodination catalyzed by D1. It was found that
D1 activity was significantly lower in the hemagiomas than
in the healthy surrounding tissue (p = 0.0017). The results
indicated that thyroid hormones play important roles not
only in the regulation of cell metabolism, but also in cell
growth, division, and apoptosis. The active form T3 acts
through its nuclear receptors and influences the up- and
down-regulation of target genes. Healthy liver tissue
expresses a high level of D1, but disturbed D1 activity may
result in changes in the local concentration of T3 which may
impair gene transcription. These finding demonstrate a low
enzymatic activity of D1 in liver hemangioma and suggest an

Introduction

The role of thyroid hormones in carcinogenesis has been
postulated for many years. However, existing data are not
sufficient for a complete understanding of the process.
Thyroxin (T4), which is the main product of the thyroid
gland, is considered a pro-hormone and must be converted
to the active form, tri-iodothyronine (T3). T3 acts through
its nuclear receptors, i.e., thyroid hormone receptors
(TRs), and has significant influence on transcription,
translation, and cell division and differentiation. T3 is
produced by monodeiodination catalyzed by type | 10d-
othyronine deiodinase (D1). This enzyme is present in
almost all human cells, but the highest concentrations
were found in the thyroid, liver, and kidneys (Bianco
et al. 2002). Both its enzymatic activity and its gene
expression have been examined in some cancers tissues.
Significant decreases in gene expression and enzyme
activity were found in papillary thyroid cancer tissue
(Ambroziak et al. 2005; De Souza Meyer et al. 2005) as
well as in papillary and follicular thyroid cancer cell lines
(Arnaldi et al. 2005; Schreck et al. 1994), renal clear cell
cancer (Pachucki et al. 2001), lung cancer (Wawrzynska
et al. 2003), and pituitary adenomas (Baur et al. 2002;
Tannahill et al. 2002). Surprisingly, elevated D1 enzyme
activity and mRNA expression were described in human
breast cancer tissue (Debski et al. 2007; Garcia-Solis and
Aceves 2003).

There has been strong evidence that the metabolism of
thyroid hormones is disturbed in some of neoplastic tissues
(Gonzalez-Sancho et al. 2003; Jakobs et al. 2002). How-
ever, there are few available data about D1’s enzymatic
activity in benign tumors such as hemangiomas, which are
the most common primary liver tumors. Interestingly, in
this type of benign lesion an elevated level of deiodinase
type 3 (D3), which inactivates thyroid hormones, was
reported (Ho et al. 2005; Huang et al. 2005; Konrad et al.
2003).

The aim of this study was to determine the enzymatic
activity of D1 in liver hemangioma in comparison with
healthy liver tissue.

Materials and Methods

Seven tumor samples and an equal number of healthy liver
control samples were obtained from patients who under-
went liver resection for hemangioma, which is now a very
rare indication for surgical intervention. Liver resection is
limited to a very selected group of patients. There were
neither postoperative deaths nor major complications. The
group consisted of three men and four women with a mean
age of 50 years. Five patients had extended liver resection
(more than three segments). In two cases the resection
included two segments. The mean tumor size was 7.86 cm
(Table 1). The samples were taken from the tumor as well
as from a site far from it, which was macroscopically
normal liver tissue. These noncancerous tissues were
assigned as controls. Immediately after the surgical pro-
cedures, the samples were frozen in carbon dioxide snow
and kept at —70°C until needed. In addition, a blood
sample for thyroid hormone determination (TSH, fT3, and
fT4) was taken from each patient before the operation. The
results were within the normal ranges (Table 2).

The tissue samples were thawed and then homogenized
in homogenization buffer (0.1 M PE [K2HPO4/KH2P04],

sucrose, dH,O, pH 7.0). Protein concentration was mea-
sured by the BCA (bicinchonic acid) method using bovine
albumin as the standard.

D1 activity was measured by quantification of radioac-
tive iodide released from 3’5’['*°I]-rT3, which was purified
by Sephadex LH20 column chromatography just before
each assay. It was washed out with 10 ml of H,O followed
by elution with 2 ml of 75% ethanol in 0.5-ml fractions
(this amount of 75% alcohol did not affect the reaction).
We used fractions with the highest activity (50,000—60,000
CMP-counts per minutes) and added 70 ul into each
reaction tube.

The samples were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in
phosphate buffer (0.1 M PE and 1 mM EDTA, pH 6.9)
with | nM unlabeled rT3 and 10 mM DTT. Each assay was
performed twice and there was always one extra sample
with propylthiouracyl added to show the inhibition of D1
by this agent. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by
placing the samples in an ice bath. Precipitation was then
caused by adding 100 pl of horse serum and 50 ul of 50%
trichloroacetic acid. The samples were vortex for 1.5 min
and centrifuged at 9,000 rpm for 5 min. An aliquot of the
supernatant containing '*°I, but not labeled iodothyronines,
was counted in a gamma counter (Wzard-1470, Wallac).
Final enzymatic activity was expressed as the fmol of
released '*°I per mg of protein per minute. The STATIS-
TICA program was used for the statistical analysis.

Results

As this was a preliminary study only, seven tissue samples
were examined. The median value of Dl enzyme activity
in the tumor tissue was 32 fmol/(mg-protein min) (range:
0-132). The median value of its enzymatic activity in the
healthy control samples was 549 fmol/(mg-protein min)
(range: 244—1243). D1 activity was significantly lower in the
hemagiomas than in the healthy liver samples (p < 0.0017;
Figs. 1, 2).

Discussion

The presented data showed very low, almost undetectable,
activity of D1 in 6 of the 7 investigated hemangioma tissue
samples, especially in comparison with healthy liver tissue,
which was thought to be responsible for ca. 70% of the
peripheral activation of T4 (Macke-Nauman 1990). How-
ever, more recent data suggest that more T3 may be
produced by D2 deiodination, which takes place in skeletal
muscle as well as in liver tissue (Maia et al. 2005; Salva-
tore et al. 1996). This result could be associated with the
differences in hemangioma and healthy liver tissue mor-
phology. The largest part of the tumor develops from
endothelial cells derived from epithelium, not hepatocytes.
It was demonstrated that there is a high prevalence of the
major physiological inactivator of thyroid hormones, D3,
in the epithelium, which causes results opposite to those of
D1 (Huang 2005; Huang et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2006).
The effect of D3 could appear as a very low concentration
of thyroid hormones in the lesion, but there is no strong
evidence concerning this occurrence. It seems reasonable
to investigate rT3 and fT3 concentration in situ as next part
of our studies.

It was also observed that the rapid resolution of con-
sumptive hypothyroidism in children with multiple hepatic

79

hemangiomas is a result of the high enzymatic activity of
D3 and the production of TSH-like hormone by the tumor
tissue. Children who required high doses of thyroid hor-
mones were cured following liver transplantation, which
proves the positive correlation between D3 enzyme activity
in hemangiomas and hypothyroidism. Isolated incidents
were also noted in adults (Ho et al. 2005; Huang et al.
2005; Konrad et al. 2003).

In conclusion, thyroid hormones play important roles
not only in the regulation of cell metabolism, but also in
cell growth, division, and apoptosis. The active form T3
acts through its nuclear receptors and influences the up-
and down-regulation of target genes. Disturbed activity of
D1 may result in changes in the local concentration of T3.
Furthermore, it may impair some gene transcription. Our
finding clearly demonstrates a low enzymatic activity of
D1 in liver hemangioma and suggests a so far unknown
role of thyroid hormones in this type of liver tumor, which
makes further investigation reasonable.
